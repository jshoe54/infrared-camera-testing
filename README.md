# Infrared Camera Calibration & Testing System 🔥

This project simulates an **infrared camera testing and calibration process**, similar to what a **Product & Test Engineer** might work on in an industry setting. It uses Python to:
- Simulate **infrared sensor data**
- Apply **calibration techniques** (Flat-Field Correction, Noise Reduction)
- Analyze **sensor anomalies** (hotspots, dead pixels)
- Generate **heatmaps & data reports**

## 📌 Features
✔️ **Infrared Image Simulation** using NumPy  
✔️ **Calibration & Noise Reduction** using OpenCV  
✔️ **Automated Testing & Data Analysis**  
✔️ **Visualization of Heatmaps & Sensor Anomalies**  

## 🔧 Installation
Run the following to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
