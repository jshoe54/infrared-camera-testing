# Infrared Camera Test Report ðŸ“¡

## ðŸ”¹ Objective
The goal of this project was to **simulate, calibrate, and analyze infrared camera data** to identify sensor anomalies and validate accuracy.

## ðŸ”¹ Calibration & Noise Reduction
- Flat-Field Correction (FFC) improved uniformity.
- Noise reduction eliminated random fluctuations.

## ðŸ”¹ Anomaly Detection
- **Hotspots Detected**: X high-intensity pixels identified.
- **Coldspots Detected**: X dead pixels identified.
- **Heatmap Analysis**: Thermal signature variations observed.

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion
This project successfully mimics a real-world **infrared camera testing workflow**, demonstrating:
- Data-driven **sensor analysis**
- **Python-based** testing & troubleshooting
- Calibration techniques used in **infrared imaging**.

## ðŸ“Š Visual Data
- See `images/` folder for saved test results.
